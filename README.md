# Percolation Game: A Simulation of Percolation Theory in Java

This project is an interactive simulation of percolation theory in Java. It visualizes how a grid of sites becomes connected as sites are opened randomly, demonstrating the concept of percolation.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of percolation.
- Ability to change grid size and probability values.
- Real-time display of percolation clusters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/serink123/Percolation.git
